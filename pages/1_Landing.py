st.markdown("""
Corporate bonds are debt instruments issued by companies to raise funds.  
They offer **stable returns** with lower volatility than equities and can be an excellent way to **diversify your portfolio**.  

In India, investors often compare corporate bonds with traditional options like:
- **Fixed Deposits (FDs)** â€“ Safe but low returns.  
- **Equities (Stocks)** â€“ High growth but volatile.  
- **Gold** â€“ Hedge against inflation but fluctuates.  
- **Government Bonds** â€“ Safe but lower yields.  

Let's see how **corporate bonds have performed compared to these asset classes** over the past 5 years.
